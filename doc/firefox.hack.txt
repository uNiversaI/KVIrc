Firefox Hack Guide - HelLViS69 - 2007.02.08
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@ Prologue

This guide is meant to be a simple hack to add protocols handlers to Firefox,
such as irc://
This guide is been tested on Linux, Mac and Windows.

@ How To

- Open Firefox at the url about:config
  You'll find the Firefox configuration

- Click with right button, select New, then Boolean
  As Name insert network.protocol-handler.external.irc and true as Value

- Click with right button, select New, then String
  As Name insert network.protocol-handler.app.irc
  As Value you have to insert the path of KVIrc binary, e.g. /usr/bin/kvirc,
  `which kvirc` or C:\Programs\Firefox\firefox.exe

- Make sure that network.protocol-handler.expose-all are set as true

With these simple steps you can handle irc://irc.something.tld from Firefox

If you want to add more protocols handlers, just follow the same steps changing
the protocol you want to add in Firefox and the application you want to use to
handle the new protocol
